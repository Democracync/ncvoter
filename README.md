# NCVoter.org website. 

This is a redesign of ncelectionconnection.com. Taking some queues from Google's material design, this is a cleaner version of the site, but the layout is practically the same. 

Site was created using Sass, the Jeet grid system, and will ultimately be converted into a Wordpress theme.
